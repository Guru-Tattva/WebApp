he Himalayan yogi (according to the profile book)

- Introduction to Swamiji
    • Himalayan Yogi, Satguru Shree Shivkrupanand Swamiji is the propagator of Samarpan Meditation of the Himalayas. From the age of about five, He had a strong curiosity to know Parmatama (God). After many attempts, a Guru came in His life under supernatural circumstances and thus began His rigorous spiritual practice and penance in the proximity of the Gurus resident in the Himalayas. After about 16 years of this practice, He came back to society in the year 1994 to fulfil the tasks assigned to him by His Himalayan Gurus, which are as follows:
May the whole world attain inner experience so as to awaken man's humanity thus leading to awakening the sense – ‘the whole world is one family’.
By obtaining inner experience, while doing their spiritual practice, the youth should make themselves capable of giving birth to virtuous and uplifted souls.
Women should recover their lost high position in society so that the inequality and yawning gap between men and women that has been going on for thousands of years can be bridged.
Connecting saints of the society with meditation
    • Shree Gurushaktidhams (Meditation Temples) should be constructed with such a resolve that future generations can also obtain self-awareness in the next 800 years.

- Journey
Timeline : 
    • 8 November, 1954  Born 
    • Begun quest for Paramatma during Childhood
    • Repeated sighting of three scenes
    • Journey to Nepal and meeting with Shree Shiv Baba
    • And thus began the Himalayan journey
    • Austere penance with many Satgurus

Swamiji was born in a lower middle class Maharashtrian Brahmin family on 8 November, 1954. His mother was a religious, gentle, calm, and soft-spoken woman. Swamiji received religious values from his maternal grandparents and mother. But Swamiji's quest was different from all of them, He wished to meet Paramatma and obtain the spiritual experience of Paramatma’s energy.
When He used to go into solitude, He would see three things simultaneously in His meditation. First, He used to see the Pashupatinath temple of Nepal. Second, He used to see a sage in the Himalayas, who was very tall and majestic. He used to keep both His hands towards Swamiji in such a way, as if He was calling Him! And third, He used to see a small Shiva temple situated on a hill. He did not know how these three things were inter-related but seeing them was the only hope that there was someone who wanted to meet Him. 
During His work trip, Param Pujya Gurudev had a chance to go to Nepal and fulfil His desire of visiting Pashupatinath. Surprisingly, an unknown person had come from the Shibu village of Nepal to pick Him up and he told Param Pujya Gurudev that he had been sent by Shree Shiv Baba to fetch Him. After three days of difficult journey, when Gurudev reached Shibu village and met Shree Shiv Baba, He felt that this was the same sage whom He had seen repeatedly in His meditation.
When Shree Shiv Baba sprinkled water on Param Pujya Gurudev, He went into a state of Samadhi for three days. During this time, Shree Shiv Baba transferred all the powers of penance and spiritual practice of His life to Param Pujya Gurudev.
Later He prophesied and said, "You still have to take care of completing some work in this life. After that is done, you will become a saint and millions of souls in this world will attain moksha (liberation) through your medium. And this indeed is your work because this is the assurance that you have given to people in your previous birth."
After this event, Param Pujya Swamiji's life continued as usual for a few years. His job continued as before. Later, He got married and was blessed with a son. When His son was about one and a half years old, He left His job (He was a marketing manager) for His spiritual growth which was driven by His inner inspiration. His wife (Her Holiness Guruma) completely backed his decision.
After a few months, a Satguru, Brahmanand Swamiji came to His house. He told Her Holiness Guruma, "He has not come for your family. His family is the entire world. His work is going to be done on a global scale. You hand Him over to me."
Her Holiness Guruma happily agreed and from there began His rigorous spiritual practice in the inaccessible mountains of the Himalayas, in the proximity of many Satgurus!
Many Satguru’s transferred their knowledge to Param Pujya Swamiji and sent Him to the next Satguru. Param Pujya Swamij had to cross many inaccessible/snowy mountains on foot to reach each and every Satguru. He had to face several challenges at every step. After reaching the next Satguru, He accepted Him as Paramatma personified and served Him with a feeling of complete surrender while carrying out His spiritual practice. Each Satguru made Param Pujya Swamiji aware of the great purpose of His life and helped Him realise the powers that were within Him (Swamiji).
In this way, He received knowledge from many sages, ascetics, and Kaivalya-Kumbhaka yogis in the Himalayas. While receiving knowledge from different Gurus, Swamiji learned about those spiritual sanskaar (Values) of meditation which paves the way for every soul to attain moksha. Since it is beyond religion, race, language and gender, all the souls of the world can do that meditation.
Per Guru's direction, Swamiji brought those meditation Sanskar (values) to society. Every human being in the world can attain the knowledge of this meditation through complete surrender.

Purposes of returning to society
    • Promotion and raising awareness of the inner knowledge among common people ; Vision : Vasudhaiv kutumbakam - The whole world as a family
    • By getting involved in meditation, the youth become so capable and worthy that they can give birth to pious souls. Vision : the incarnation of pious souls and Guru-energies
    • Women should recover their lost high position in society so that the inequality and yawning gap between men and women that has been going on for thousands of years can be bridged. Vision: Awakening the feminine energy
    • In the religions where meditation was prominent, meditation has almost disappeared and only rituals are left. With the aim of restoring meditation, Param Pujya Swamiji has been taking meditation programs for saints of various religions. Vision: Connecting saints of the society with meditation
    • The creation of the Shree Gurushaktidham, where a Guru establishes his powers in a specific place before leaving his body. And any soul in the world, irrespective of race, religion, country, language, colour or gender, can attain self-realisation from that living idol. Vision: Creating a system for self-realisation for future generations

Swamiji’s Wisdom - (need to think of a title) visionary takes on material order (this section can have his opinion on stuff like - aura validation system for Gurus and more)

In order to fulfill the profound purposes and goals of his Himalayan Gurus, Param Pujya Swamiji surrendered his entire life for the service of humanity and since the year 1994 , he has been tirelessly and continuously performing his Guru Karya (tasks assigned by the Spiritual Gurus). He is constantly striving with continuous efforts towards completion of his goals which are, the attainment of quick spiritual progress of the entire mankind and in this respect, Swamiji keeps sharing his thoughts, vision, new researches and experiments with all sadhaks .
To give unconditionally is Swamiji’s innate nature and moreover he doesn’t even bother whether the individual in front of him is worthy of receiving this wisdom or not. Only because he firmly believes that the individual in front of him has been divinely sent to him by his Gurus for the purpose of Self Realization.
While fulfilling his family duties and responsibilities as a householder, Swamiji has attained the highest state of enlightenment / highest meditative state. He is a perfect living example of the fact that meditation is not only for saints, spiritual seekers but also for householders.
Truly speaking, Swamiji is a living embodiment , who is full of love and compassion. In reality , he has achieved the Shoonya state which is beyond good and bad, where He has completely merged with the Divine Consciousness (Paramatma). His spiritual state can also be understood by the picture of his Aura.
