What is real meaning of
Meditation and Yog

    • Meditation means Living in the present moment
    • The world understands Meditation as the attainment of a thoughtless state whereas the fact is that Meditation begins only after the point where one attains a thoughtless state
    • The meaning of Yog is to Unite/Connect. The Union of man’s body with his soul and when this Union happens, no duality remains . They become One.
    • As a matter of fact, the true meaning of Yog is the Union of the Body and Soul .
    • Yog means to Connect. To connect the Inner Consciousness with the Universal Consciousness. In its true sense, Yog is the art of management of the entire life of a human being .
    • The common man spends his entire life living in the gross physical body consciousness. Whereas a yogi spends his life living in the Soul consciousness. There is dominance of soul consciousness over the physical body consciousness in the life of a Yogi.

Himalayan Dhyanyog Sanskar- A transference/ transmission of values by the Guru’s soul to the disciple’s soul.
    • Igniting the Inner Light- Awakening of the Soul consciousness
    • An introversive state- Focusing one’s attention inward to connect with one’s soul consciousness.
    • One starts to see their own flaws and weaknesses as one’s attention turns within.
    • Surrendering the poison of one’s past memories/ experiences and suffering into the vast ocean of collectivity.
    • If the Soul consciousness is strong, the Chitta will always be focused on the Soul. Chitta is that source of energy through which the pure consciousness (Chaitanya) keeps flowing constantly. If you keep your attention (Chitta) constantly on the Soul (Aatma) then your soul consciousness will start to become stronger. As a result, the Soul consciousness (Aatma bhaav) will start becoming dominant over the gross physical body consciousness (Shareer bhaav). And when this happens , then our life starts becoming free of suffering.
Control of the Chitta
    • We all have a Mind that produces continuous thoughts and riding on these thoughts that the mind creates, the Chitta starts to picture that scene .
    • There is a very deep relationship between the Chitta and the Soul (Aatma). You can say that the Chitta is the “Eye of the Soul”.
    • The Mind thinks and experiences happiness and sadness but the Chitta is beyond all these qualities. The Chitta is like a camera that always visualizes the picture that the mind creates
    • In reality it is not the mind that wanders, it is the Chitta that wanders. The mind is only creating the thoughts

a transmission of values / divine wisdom from a pure soul of the Guru to another pure
soul of the recipient.
    • Self Realization (Aatma Sakshaatkaar) - Just like sowing a seed, it is an introduction to one’s soul consciousness that is gradually converted into a deep connection with one’s Soul consciousness with the consistent practice of the Himalayan Meditation.
    • Totally Immersive and Experience based - Feelings of Joy, bliss and happiness. Experiencing a deep state of thoughtlessness, experiencing vibrations beneath the soles of the feet and the energy centres ( chakras), feeling of pure Inner Bliss, hearing Brahmanaad( the primordial sound of creation AUM), having different kind of experiences according to one’s spiritual state/ level.

Health Benefits
According to the Yogic Science, all the ailments are caused due to the imbalance of the subtle energy centers called Chakras that are located in our energy body.
When our chakras are activated and balanced through the meditation practice, we can protect ourselves and even cure ourselves from all kind of physical sickness or psychological ailments
Meditation boosts the immune system as per scientific research
Mental Calm and Peace
The quantity of thoughts reduces and one experiences a kind of mental silence. A doctor can treat the diseases of the gross physical body with medication but there is no medicine for the mental suffering. The only solution for mental suffering is practicing Meditation- (Dhyan Yog)
Increase in mental focus and productivity
Freedom from Addictions/Drug abuse
When the inner consciousness is awakened, your soul becomes your Guru and you start receiving guidance and wisdom from within yourself- what is to be done and what is not to be done. As a result, one starts to get the urge from within, to leave any addictions that are harmful to the body and mind.
Awakening of Dharma
Here the word Dharma implies, the knowledge/wisdom as to what should you be doing in your life and what should you not be doing, what is right for you and what is not right for you. This guidance starts coming from within yourself. And once a human being starts receiving this inner wisdom, then he/she is able to make the right choices in one’s life and we start becoming successful in our life journey, knowing our true life purpose ( Swadharma).
Attainment of Liberation (Moksha)
Every human being has a purpose or a goal in their life and that is to attain Self Realization.
But Liberation (Moksha) is that state which one has to attain during one’s lifespan, while living in the body and not after the death of this body.
Union with Parmatma
(Higher Consciousness)
Man’s greatest search in life is to attain Self Realization / Union with Paramatma. Through consistent practice of Meditation (Dhyan Yog), the Chitta turns inward and one starts experiencing the presence of Divine Consciousness (Paramatma) within oneself.
A complete life Solution
“I understood my true purpose of life and I attained Paramatma (Self Realization) in this lifetime itself.”
Becoming your own Guru
(Master)
What is good and what is not good for us in life-this knowledge/ wisdom will start coming internally from within yourself and not externally from the outside.
Control over the Chitta
Meditation is like bathing/cleansing/purification of the Chitta. The Chitta acquires a very important place in the life of a human being. The Chitta may be full with the good or the bad, all of this occupies space in the Chitta.
In order to live a successful, healthy and a happy life in the future, it is very important to empty the Chitta. Only when the Chitta becomes empty, only then it will be purified. Meaning there will be no good or bad people in it. Only when it is emptied, will it become pure. Only when the Chitta is pure, will it become strong. Only when the Chitta becomes strong, will it be able to connect with the Divine energies of God (Paramatma).

- Call to action (need to think) - attend shibir? Call us? Whatever is the right cta?
Video Shibir
In a video shibir, seekers receive all the knowledge while staying at their own locations, and the sacred consciousness needed for self-realisation is transmitted remotely through the pure chitta od Param Pujya Gurudev. The astonishing experiences shared by participants stand as living proof of the success of this innovation.
In these video shibirs, recordings of the in-person Mahashibirs conducted by Param Pujya Swamiji are shown. These shibirs are conducted for one, three, or eight days.
    • With this new system, it is as if the spiritual energies have been decentralised. Now, several video shibirs are organised across the world every month, through which thousands of people attain self-knowledge.
